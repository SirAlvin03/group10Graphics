# 3D car ray tracing

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a web-based application that utilizes ray tracing to render a realistic 3D scene featuring a car. Users will be able to interact with the scene, adjusting parameters such as the car's position, lighting conditions, and camera angles.

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Set Up the Project Structure
Start by organizing the project files and folders. Create the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Consider using a web development framework or build the structure manually.

### 2. Create the 3D Car Model
Choose or create a 3D model of a car. You can use existing models available online or create one using modeling software. Ensure the model includes necessary details like reflections, shadows, and realistic materials.

### 3. Implement Basic HTML Structure
Set up the basic HTML structure for the project, linking the necessary CSS and JavaScript files. Create a canvas element where the 3D scene will be rendered.

### 4. Set Up and Three.js
In the JavaScript file, set up WebGL and use the Three.js library for simplified 3D graphics
