# RayDrive

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a web-based application that utilizes ray tracing to render a realistic 3D scene featuring a car. Users will be able to interact with the scene, adjusting parameters such as the car's position, lighting conditions, and camera angles.
This will be available for a handful of environments.
